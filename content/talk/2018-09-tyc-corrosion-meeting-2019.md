We are happy to announce that we are having a one-day corrosion meeting at Imperial College (London) on Thursday 25 April 2019. 
Support is from the Thomas Young Centre (https://www.thomasyoungcentre.org/)

The topic of the meeting will be focused on 'fundamentals of the electrochemistry of the metal/electrolyte interface'. 

Please see the meeting website for more information (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/naturalsciences/chemistry/eventssummary/event_10-12-2018-10-26-45).
