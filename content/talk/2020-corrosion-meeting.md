This meeting will continue the success of the previous meeting, with a focus on the aqueous corrosion of metals. The emphasis this time will be on longer length scale simulations (*i.e.* longer than from standard atomistic methods). Funding for this event is from the EPSRC.

This page will be updated with more details closer to the event
