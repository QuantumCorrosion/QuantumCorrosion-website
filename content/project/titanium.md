Titanium alloys are relatively corrosion resistant, but in the aerospace sector
suffer stress corrosion cracking following degreasing in chlorine-containing
agents, or even after handling by salty fingers! When titanium is used for
medical implants, corrosion is a principal cause of failure; for example,
localised wear of an implant exposes a small area of metal establishing a large
anodic current density and localised metal wastage.
