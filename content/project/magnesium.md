Magnesium alloys are lightweight and strong, but technological applications are
limited by high rates of aqueeous corrosion (even damp air is sufficient!). 

Magnesium can used for medical implants that are designed to dissolve over
time, hence corrosion is desirable.
However, the corrosion rate needs to be controlled to prevent damaging hydrogen
build up.
